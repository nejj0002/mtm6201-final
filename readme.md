## Technologies & Resources Used

### Frameworks & Libraries
* **[Bootstrap v5.3](https://getbootstrap.com/):** Used as the primary CSS framework for layout, components, and responsiveness.
* **[Font Awesome v6.5](https://fontawesome.com/):** Used for icons throughout the site (e.g., phone, map marker).

### Fonts
* **UI Font:** The site uses the default system UI font stack provided by Bootstrap for clean and fast rendering (`'Segoe UI', Tahoma, Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif`).

### Image Assets
The images used in this project were sourced from the project brief.
* `hero-hands.jpg`: Hero background image.
* `dessert-1.jpg`, `dessert-2.jpg`: Feature images on the home page.
* `chef.jpg`, `chef-sm.jpg`: Image of the chef on the menu page.
* `track-meal.jpg`, `track-meal-sm.jpg`: Main image on the orders page.
* `gallery-1.jpg` to `gallery-4.jpg`: Images for the gallery on the orders page.

*Note: Smaller versions of images (e.g., `-sm.jpg`) were created for use in the `<picture>` element to demonstrate responsive image loading.*
